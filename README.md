# Python
  Python is a programming language that lets you tell a computer what to do. It is easy to read, write, and understand, making it great for beginners and professionals alike.

 # Introduction to Programming
   Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so that it can perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language. Learning programming helps you automate tasks, solve problems, and create software.

 # Basic Programming Concepts
  # Variables 
  A variable is a storage space in a computer's memory that holds data. You can change its value while the program is running.
                 
    name = "Satwika"   # stores text
    age = 22          # stores a number
    height = 5.3       # stores a decimal number

 name → stores a string

  String:- A string is a piece of text in python, like words, sentences, or any characters.

age → stores an integer

 Integer :- An integer is a whole number 

height → stores a float
  
  Float:- A float is a number with a decimal point

# Data Types    
  A data type in Python tells the computer what kind of value a variable holds. It helps Python understand how to use the data (for calculations, storing text, making decisions, etc.). Different operations are valid for different types.

| Data Type               | Description          | Example                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Integer (`int`)**     | Whole numbers        | 10, -5, 0                    |
| **Float (`float`)**     | Decimal numbers      | 3.14, -0.5                   |
| **String (`str`)**      | Text                 | "Hello", "Satwika"           |
| **Boolean (`bool`)**    | True or False values | True, False                  |
| **List (`list`)**       | Collection of items  | [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b"]        |
| **Tuple (`tuple`)**     | Immutable collection | (1, 2, 3)                    |
| **Dictionary (`dict`)** | Key-value pairs      | {"name": "Satwika", "age": 22} |

# Integer 
   An integer (often called int) is a whole number — a number without any decimal point.
It can be positive, negative, or zero.
   
    # examples of integers
    a = 10        # positive integer
    b = -3        # negative integer
    c = 0         # zero

# Float (float)  

decimal numbers: 3.14, -0.5     
   
 A float (short for floating-point number) is a number that has a decimal point.
 It is used when you need fractional or precise values, not just whole numbers.

# String (str) 
  
  text enclosed in quotes: "hello"

  A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

         name = "Satwika"
         language = 'Python'
         print(name)
         print(language)

     
        text = "Hello"
        print(type(text))
       # Output: <class 'str'>


 # Boolean (bool)
 
   True or False

  A Boolean (in Python, type bool) is a data type that can have only two possible values:
✅ True or ❌ False

Booleans are used to represent yes/no, on/off, right/wrong, or 1/0 type of logic.

       is_student = True
       is_adult = False

       print(is_student)   # True
       print(type(is_student))   # <class 'bool'>

# List 

ordered, changeable sequence:

Lists are used to:

  Store multiple values in one place.

  Easily add, remove, update, or access data.

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    print(fruits[0])   # apple
    print(fruits[1])   # banana
    print(fruits[2])   # cherry

# Tuple 
  
  Ordered, immutable sequence:

  A Tuple in Python is a collection of items
       
  Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change, add, or remove items once created.

     tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
     tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
     combined = tuple1 + tuple2
     print(combined)
    # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

 # Dictionary (dict) 
   
  key → value pairs:

  A Dictionary in Python is a collection of data stored in key–value pairs.

  Dictionaries are written inside curly braces { }.

     # Example 1: Simple dictionary
     person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
    }

    # Example 2: Mixed data types
    student = {
    "name": "Emma",
    "age": 19,
    "marks": [85, 90, 92],
    "is_passed": True
    }

    # Example 3: Empty dictionary
    data = {}

  # Set 
  
  unordered collection of unique items:

  A Set in Python is a collection of unique and unordered items.

  Need to store unique values only.

  Want to perform mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

  Don’t care about the order of elements.

     empty = {}
     print(type(empty))  # <class 'dict'>

    empty_set = set()
    print(type(empty_set))  # <class 'set'>


# Conditionals 
   
  Decision making
