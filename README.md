 # Introduction to Programming
   Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so that it can perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language. Learning programming helps you automate tasks, solve problems, and create software.

 # Basic Programming Concepts
  # Variables 
  A variable is a storage space in a computer's memory that holds data. You can change its value while the program is running.
                 
    name = "Satwika"   # stores text
    age = 22          # stores a number
    height = 5.3       # stores a decimal number

 name → stores a string

  String:- A string is a piece of text in python, like words, sentences, or any characters.

age → stores an integer

 Integer :- An integer is a whole number 

height → stores a float
  
  Float:- A float is a number with a decimal point

# Data Types    
  A data type in Python tells the computer what kind of value a variable holds. It helps Python understand how to use the data (for calculations, storing text, making decisions, etc.). Different operations are valid for different types.

| Data Type               | Description          | Example                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Integer (`int`)**     | Whole numbers        | 10, -5, 0                    |
| **Float (`float`)**     | Decimal numbers      | 3.14, -0.5                   |
| **String (`str`)**      | Text                 | "Hello", "Satwika"           |
| **Boolean (`bool`)**    | True or False values | True, False                  |
| **List (`list`)**       | Collection of items  | [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b"]        |
| **Tuple (`tuple`)**     | Immutable collection | (1, 2, 3)                    |
| **Dictionary (`dict`)** | Key-value pairs      | {"name": "Satwika", "age": 22} |

# Integer 
   An integer (often called int) is a whole number — a number without any decimal point.
It can be positive, negative, or zero.
    # examples of integers
    a = 10        # positive integer
    b = -3        # negative integer
    c = 0         # zero
